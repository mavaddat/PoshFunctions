## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

## NOTES
Updated logic around keys to the working hash.
If any of the words in the file match PowerShell keywords you'll
get a bunch of error messages.
Workaround stores hash in slightly different manner.
Forced each word to lower case
Sorted Word frequency in descending order, then word in ascending order
Changed properties from (Name, Value) to (Word, Frequency) to better reflect their meanings
