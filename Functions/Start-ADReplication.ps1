function Start-ADReplication {
    <#
.SYNOPSIS
    Forces replication to occur between domain controllers in domain.
.DESCRIPTION
    Forces replication to occur between domain controllers in domain. Invoke-Command to a DC. Requires to be running in elevated Powershell prompt.
.PARAMETER Name
    A string array containing the name, fqdn or ipaddress of a domain controller. If not specified will query AD for a domain controller. Aliased to 'DomainController', 'DC', 'CN', 'ComputerName'

    Optional, defaults to $env:COMPUTERNAME
.PARAMETER Quiet
    Switch will create no output
.EXAMPLE
    Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | Start-ADReplication

    Will return a list of all DCs and run the replication against that list
.EXAMPLE
    Get-ADDomainController -Filter "Name -like '*CORP*'" | Start-ADReplication

    Will return a list of all DCs that have 'CORP' in their name and run the replication against that list
.EXAMPLE
    Start-ADReplication -Name DC1 -Verbose

    Assuming there are two DCs (DC1, DC2) in the contosco.com domain here is a sample return
    VERBOSE: Starting [Start-ADReplication]
    VERBOSE: $Name is [DC1]
    VERBOSE: Processing [DC1]
    DC1 DC2 "DC=contosco,DC=com" - Sync from DC2 to DC1 completed successfully.
    DC1 DC2 "CN=Configuration,DC=contosco,DC=com" - Sync from DC2 to DC1 completed successfully.
    DC1 DC2 "CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=contosco,DC=com" - Sync from DC2 to DC1 completed successfully.
    DC1 DC2 "DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=contosco,DC=com" - Sync from DC2 to DC1 completed successfully.
    DC1 DC2 "DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=contosco,DC=com" - Sync from DC2 to DC1 completed successfully.

.NOTES
    * Reworked logic so it just replicates the links that are defined. Previously it ran repadmin.exe with /ApeD switch
      and it was horribly slow.
    * Changed parameter $DC to $Name so that it would take input from Get-ADDomainController and to accept an array and
      added aliases to it
    * Changed output so that it would remove blank or commented lines from the output and to display what is being
      replicated in the output
    * Changed output so that it creates CSV output
    * Added '-ThrottleLimit' to the Invoke-Command so as to not saturate the local computer. Changed value to
      [environment]::ProcessorCount which is the number of processors on the computer.
    * Changed $Name to optional and defaulting to $env:COMPUTERNAME
